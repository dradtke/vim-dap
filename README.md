This repository contains a (very alpha) Vim plugin for integrating with the
[Debug Adapter Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/debug-adapter-protocol/).
The hope is to bring a consistent debugging experience to Vim for any language
server that supports the protocol.

The motivator behind this project is to enable debugging via Microsoft's
[java-debug](https://github.com/microsoft/java-debug) project, which extends
[eclipse.jdt.ls](https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse.jdt.ls) to provide
debugging support.
